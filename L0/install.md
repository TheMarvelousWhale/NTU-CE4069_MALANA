# Instructions for installation

Let's get it.

The school wants us to install FlareVM on Win 10, but I discovered that win 10 has a lot of forward compatibility issues with Flare. As such, if you want to take the risk of installing flare on win10, go forward :D God bless you. 

For me, I should have used flareVM/Remnux but well the experience of manually installing my tools and manage them is quite fun too. 

I use these two machines, but you can just use a single win 7 with all the tools

1. Win 10 fresh install with IDA, Ghidra, Process Monitor, Process Hacker, PEBear, PEiD, PEViewer, Wireshark, Regshot, Ollydbg, x64dbg, Strings, CFFExplorer, Python 2.7.16 with pe module. 
   
2. Win 7 with Fakenet because my fakenet on win 10 didn't work 

```
If I had the chance to do it again, I will just install everything on a win 7 machine instead of following the course's instructions. 
```

So therefore if you want to restart, I would recommend the following:
1. Fresh win 7 install (VM can be found in my Tutorial 2, charles.exe section)
   
2. Change your setting to NAT to download all the relevant tools, Enable 
   Birectional Shared Clipboard and Drag & Drop (Vbox's Device tab on top pane)
3. Install IDA, Process Monitor, Process Hacker, PEBear, PEiD, PEViewer, Wireshark, Regshot, Ollydbg (and any other things you like)
   
4. Switch network setting back to Host Only 
   
5. Save this as golden snapshot. Then drag your malware in and unzip :D Save more snapshots to make life easier. 

That's my advice! 

Any questions just leave me a git issues on the repo of this page.
