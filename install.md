# Instructions for installation

The school wants us to install FlareVM on Win 10, but I discovered that win 10 has a lot of forward compatibility issues with Win 10. As such, if you want to take the risk of installing flare on win10, go forward :D god bless you. 

For me, I DO NOT use flareVM -- for the experience of manually installing my tools and manage them. 

I use these two machines, but you can just use a single win 7 with all the tools

1. Win 10 fresh install with IDA, Ghidra, Process Monitor, Process Hacker, PEBear, PEiD, PEViewer, Wireshark, Regshot, Ollydbg, x64dbg
   
2. Win 7 with Fakenet because my fakenet on win 10 didn't work 

```
If I had the chance to do it again, I will just install everything on a win 7 machine instead of following the course's instructions. 
```

So therefore if you want to restart, I would recommend the following:
1. Fresh win 7 install (VM can be found in my Tutorial 2, charles.exe section)
   
2. Change your setting to NAT to download all the relevant tools, Enable 
   Birectional Shared Clipboard and Drag & Drop (Vbox's Device tab on top pane)
3. Install IDA, Process Monitor, Process Hacker, PEBear, PEiD, PEViewer, Wireshark, Regshot, Ollydbg (and any other things you like)
   
4. Switch network setting back to Host Only 
   
5. Save this golden snapshot. Then drag your malware in and unzip :D 


Any questions just leave me a git issues on the repo of this page. 

Adios :>
