# Tutorial 8 (WIP)

Double shot this week because I'm having fun (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

Let's get started! 


## Menu

[kate.exe](#kate)

[lala.exe](#lala)

Alright let's go ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ

## <a name="kate">kate.exe</a>

Check the hash 

![kate hash](./Assets/khash.PNG)

It is based off the Practical Malware Lab 7-1. Then it is similar to Alice.exe which you can find at [this repo also](./../L1/L1.md).

### a.	How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted? Please provide specifics

Oldest tricks in the book: check the strings 

![k strings](./Assets/kstrings.PNG)

Then use the cross-ref of these variables to work backwards LMAO. I already work on Alice.exe ┐(‘～` )┌ I know the inner working of this malware. It creates malservice and also use a mutex. However now is 8 weeks down the road, so I can explain in _a lot_ more details. 

The service is called in main, quite early:

![malservice](./Assets/kmalservice.PNG)

The service invokes [StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera) that will start a service (this is just part of the init routine)

![mal](./Assets/kmal.PNG) 

Where the task to be run is SOSIG_MUTEX (renamed). 

Looking into that: 

![specs](./Assets/kmalspecs.PNG)

We will need to take a look at MSDN for [CreateServiceA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicea). 

Take note of the 

dwStartType set to 2 -- SERVICE_AUTO_START 0x00000002
```
A service started automatically by the service control manager during system startup. 
```
dwServiceType set to 10 -- SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS 0x00000010
```
Service that runs in its own process. 
```
The binary path is set to the fullpath of the current process (i  explained this in tutorial L7 about the 0 handle thing to GetModuleFileNameA). 

So when it registers the service to SCM, SCM will auto run it during startup as a service, using the full path of the malware. (not very stealthy though, but it is persistent since SCM registered it already). 


### b.	Why does this program use a mutex? 

Tbh it doesn't have to. It likes to keep one instance running. That's about it. Or is there some functions that requires mutex inside the malware? IDK (・_・ヾ )

Anyway, the mutex is CE4069. Prof has gotten less creative with the naming. Where is "ProfLamlikesmilopengkosong.com" (つω`｡) 
	
### c.	What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program? 

'http://www.eatingmalwarelabinc.com' 

![kspam](./Assets/kspam.PNG)

It just makes a lot of connections. 

### d.	What is the purpose of this program? Elaborate your answers with justification from the assembly code. 

It is a spambot that tries to overwhelm the url in part d. I have done this in Alice.exe :> Please refer to the In-Depth section of Alice.exe for more details. 

```
Register the service
Create a timer of till 0x7E6 year -- wait till 2022
Create 20 thread (shown below) whose task is at __StartAddress__ subroutine
```

### e.	How do you would advise on how to remove this malware?

The service requires the fullpath of the malware. Just go and delete it. 

Or use sc.exe to remove it from scm

Or both. 

## <a name="lala">lala.exe</a>

When I first do this I thought it was hollowing. Turns out due to the lack of unmapping, i think it is more of a reflective dll injection. 

Check the hash 

![lala hash](./Assets/lhash.PNG)

### a.	What is the purpose of sub_401000?

First glance through, it works in the Kernel with all the K32 functions. That's not good. 

For this part, I need to scroll up and down and google for a good while. My guess is that it is using K32EnumProcesses, K32GetModuleBaseNameW to .. idk what it's doing. Why? [The code in C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/psapi/enumerating-all-modules-for-a-process). It is enumerating processes for sure but why? 

Then it expands the path of calc.exe using ExpandEnvironmentStrings and create a Calc.exe process via CreateProcess. And it gonna be hollowed for sure looking at how it has a 4 in the dwCreationFlags. 

![l ](./Assets/lcreatesuspend.PNG)

So sub_401000 enum processes to find a process that can find calc.exe. Or it can be checking if calc.exe exists and try to get its handle. Whatever the way, it is finding calc.exe in the first half, and then:

create calc.exe in suspended mode. 

# b.	Where is the DLL dropped to? What is the significance of that path? 

To calc.exe. The advantage of this technique is that the path of the process being hollowed out will still point to the legitimate path and by executing within the context of legitimate process the malware can bypass firewalls and host intrusion prevention systems. 

After looking at it for a while, I do realized:
* pszDest is the malicious dll
* hProcess is our calc.exe 

This will be useful for the next section

### c.	What is the purpose of instruction from 0x0040125B to 0x00401390

It is injecting the Src (the malicious dll) into  the hProcess (calc.exe) -- or at least in the process of doing it:

1. lala.exe uses ZwCreateSection to create a section in calc.exe, then take the handle. 
2. It then write the content of Src (or its malicious dll) into this section via memcpy. 


### d.	What is the purpose of sub_401240? 

hello isn't that included in the previous part... Or may be you want a fuller explanation? It's just injection...  

The whole story is
1. Starts calc.exe in the suspended mode. 
2. lala.exe gets the malicious code to inject from its resource section. It will VirtualAlloc this dll into memory (mapped the dll into memory)
3. lala.exe uses ZwCreateSection to create a section in calc.exe, then take the handle. 
4. lala.exe determines the base address of calc.exe so that it can copy wholesale its malicious dll in. 
5. CreateRemote Thread via LoadLibraryW via kernel32.dll. It is so standard it can be written as below: 

```
VOID InjectDll(HANDLE hProcess, LPCSTR lpszDllPath) {
	LPVOID lpBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, dwDllPathLen, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

	WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, lpszDllPath, dwDllPathLen, &dwWritten);

	HMODULE hModule = GetModuleHandle("kernel32.dll");

	LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(hModule, "LoadLibraryA");

	CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)lpStartAddress, lpBaseAddress, 0, NULL);
}
```

I have stumbled on some nice resource while doing this tutorial
