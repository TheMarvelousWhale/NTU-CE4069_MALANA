## Tutorial 1: Basic Static Analysis

### (a) alice.exe 

We first unpack the folder into our favorite spot and disable Windows scan on that folder 

The first thing we need to do is to check the MD5 checksum of the file. 
After some googling, I found out that Win Powershell has some built in tools for this

![Alice Hash](./Assets/alice_hash.png)

So the file is uncorrupted. Now let's check the sections with **PEiD*. You can use any other tools like PEViewer or PEStudio if you like. 

![Alice sections](./Assets/alice_sections.png)

We can see that the sections are named UPX0, UPX1 and UPX2, which are characteristic of a UPX-packed program. We also noticed that the Physical size is much smaller than the Virtual size -- meaning that in the disk/drive (**R.Size**) it only take a small space, but in memory (during execution, **V.Size**) it takes up much more. This is a very clear indication of packed malware. Therefore we will need to unpack this file before proceeding further. 

I have found the original UPX packer [here](https://upx.github.io/) on github. You can download the exe into your malware lab. 

Using upx unpacker (this thing does not preserve original file... I had to unpack the original .7z for this post)

_the -d means decrypt_

After unpacking, the resulting sections look like this
