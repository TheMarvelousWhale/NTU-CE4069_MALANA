_Many thanks to enginur @NekiYong for the addition_

I do this an effort to help my friends understand the materials and often the tools in RE better. For those who wish to learn more than lecture, I tried my best to provide an in-depth section where I dissect the IDA call graph in details. 

Do understand that I am also a student and a contracted staff for a **\*_cough_\*** agency in One-North, so I will be slow in updating the content. Patience is deeply appreciated. Also, I will only upload the solution after the tutorial (so yall should come for tutorial). 

If you like what I do here, please help spread the work! It's free, and it is meant to benefit everyone. 

_ALSO, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF **LOOΠΔ** REFERENCES. LIKE....ALOT._
