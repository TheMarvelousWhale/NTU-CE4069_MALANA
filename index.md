## Welcome to NTU CE4069 Tutorial "Answers" 

_Site currently maintained by Sosig Catto (pronounced: '[sɒsɪʤz](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=sausage+ipa+pronunciation)')_

This page is where I maintain a comprehensive and often in-depth answers to the tutorials of NTU CE4069 Malware Analysis. Any errata found please kindly submit a code review (I'm open to pull requests if you want to contribute!). 

I do this an effort to help my friends understand the materials and often the tools in RE better. For those who wish to learn more than lecture, I tried my best to provide an in-depth section where I dissect the IDA call graph in details. 

Do understand that I am also a student and a contracted staff for a **\*_cough_\*** agency in One-North, so I will be slow in updating the content. Patience is deeply appreciated. Also, I will only upload the solution after the tutorial (so yall should come for tutorial). 

If you like what I do here, please help spread the work! It's free, and it is meant to benefit everyone.
