## 1. Do and Dont's 

*Do*

* always do shit in a host-only no shared folder VM. Store the malware in .zip/.txt format
* Document results and findings along the way, taking snapshots as necessary. Actually snap as frequently and liberally as you like. 

*Don't*

* Upload to VirusTotal
* Detonate in an unsafe env
* Connect to attacker's IP

## 2. Static

*PE header*
refer to the slides. Main part are:
* DOS header (4d5a MZ)
* COFF header (50-45-00-00) (also known by "PE header" - but i found this highly confusing). Contains compilation time. 
* Data directories: pointer to imports, exports, etc
* Section tables: refer to lecture 2 slide 23 for the section details. The CE peeps yall better know this since 2007 or Hong Lye will be very disappointed. 

*Strings*
* strings can be ascii, unicode or other locale strings. strings are big tell-tale sign and often (but not always) good host indicator / indicator of packed/encrypted malware. Strings like IP addresses, mutex names, registry keys are very clear-cut signs. 

*Packed*
* Packing refers to the compression of the whole malware, making it illegible. The malware will use an unpacker to unpack itsels during run-time. 
* Popular choice: UPX, MPRESS, Themida, Obsidium etc 
* See in section size if virtual size >> physical size, indicating that malware take up more space in RAM/Memory than in disk => packed. 
* To unpack, we can (1) use their respective unpacker (2) if packing is custom, let the malware unpack itself, fix the IAT and import tables then Olly. 

*Obfuscation*
* Refers to a list of technique that can use to make analysis difficult (including packing). Can obfuscate strings (base64, xor,... ), junk code, control flow flattening (make a nested if-else "ladder" flat), encryption of various sort.

*Honorable mention: export and import table*
We can see how the malware interact with the environment via the API it imports and exports.

## 3. Dynamic

*how to lauch binaries*
* click on it if exe
* rundll.exe or ollydbg it if dll. May require referencing ordinal number, e.g. rundll32.exe sample.dll,#82
* net start AppMgmt if service dll (alice.exe)

*DGA*
* to generate a domain during runtime. Think of malloc but for domain name. The DGA can generate a time-sensitive domain that can then be registered and deregistered by the malware author.
* structure:
  * seed | generator function(seed) | TLD set
* How to blocK: 
  * Filter | Score domain name | Pattern Matching | RE
* Types of DGA:
  *  Arithmetic | wordlist | hash based | permutation based

## 4. Persistence

10 techniques:

1. Run registry: 
   * \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. 
   * To survive reboot. 
2. Winlogon: 
   *  HKEY SHell, Userinit, SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows. 
   *  To start malware when winlogon starts. 
3. IFEO: debugger priveleged malware
4. Accessibility: open cmd.exe with full privilege upon sticky key activation/Narration/etc (other accessibility services)
5. AppInit_Dlls HKEY: allow malware to be loaded into any process that load user32.dll 
6. Startup folder: 
   * HKEY Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup. 
   * _I used this folder to open my google calendar upon startup. It's pretty neat._
7. Scheduled task: cron (unix) or schtasks. This is mainly to allow malware to be executed periodically (e.g keep heartbeat to C2). Schtask could also be used as a timebomb, e.g. synchronise DDoS at certain date-time. 
8. Service: create a malservice (sc create, CreateService() StartService() OpenScManager() API) or inject malware into existing service.
9.  Dll Search order hijacking: mess with the lookup process of a dll name to load a malicious dll. Key takeaway is that search begins in application's directory and it has a certain hierachy (certain Hive are searched before others). Thus, if malware drops malicious DLL into privileged application's directory/hive then haha.
10. COM hijack: modify a legit COM object/ mess up the lookup proces by creating a malicious COM object of higher search order (Windows will look into that HKEY first before looking into the legit one)

## 5. Assembly and Code Construct

Refer to tutorial 4 and 5. 

Key points:
* know EAX (and AX, AH, AL) and the corr E{BCD}X **size** and the arithmetic operations on them (ADD, SUB, INC, IMUL, IDIV, UMUL, UDIV, SHR, SAR, SHL). Pay special attention to how many bytes are being used (BYTE ptr? DWORD ptr? etc). 
* Know the syntax of MOV, MOVZX and LEA
* know most of the common assembly instruction
* know how is arguments and local var is laid in the stack. Also EBP and RET addr position. 
* The array instructions repe cmpsb, rep stosb, rep movsb, repne scasb. They are the memcmp, memset, memcpy and findbyte of assembly
* If, If-else, nested if "ladder", For loop, While loop, JMP table (switch)
* cecdl vs stdcall: params pushed right to left (aka rightmost at the bottom of the stack). stdcall's callee clean stack with sub, esp argc*4
* Function call: internall call \<name of function\> vs import call ds:\<name in IAT\>

## 6. Wins API:

haiz i seriously dont know how to do this part

*File*:
* CreateFile (dwCreationDisposition Flag is important - 0x03 is existing)
* GetTempPath, GetTemFileName, GetSystemDirectory together with strcat to build fullpath name in %SYSTEM% or %TEMP%
* CopyFile, WriteFile,ReadFile,DeleteFile
* MovFileEx -- dwFlag has the DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT (0x04) and NULL will cause DELETE instead of moving during reboot. See Tutorial 7

*FileSystem*
* CreateMapping and MapViewOfFile: share data among processes. Used by malware to read and modify PE
* FindFirtstFile and FindNextFile: files enum

*Registry*:
* Create OpenKey EnumKey QueryValue SetValue Close: do exactly as their name

*Network*:
* Client: | WSAStartup | Socket | Connect 
* Server: | WSAStartup | Socket | Bind | Listen
* WSA GetLastError, gethostbyname, WSACleanup, inet_addr & inet_ntoa (converting IP notaton), hton & ntoh (converting port notation) are helpful helper functions
* The order of Send and Recv may be tell tale if it's a backdoor recving command or a client. 

*Process and Thread (P\|T)*:
* Create{P\|T}, GetCurrent{P\|T}Id,Open{P\|T}, CreateRemote{P\|T} -- this one the most malicious one as it create a freestyle {P\|T}. 
* The VirtualAllocEx and other memory stuff I will explain in Injection

*Mutex*: is not that important. Just make an educated guess during exam. 

## 7. Injection Techniques:

The most fun and challenging part of all. I will detailed out the classic DLL injection, and then go through the signature functions of each techniques. Sample code is given in hyperlink. 

1. The classical Mozart of [dll injection](https://0x00sec.org/t/reflective-dll-injection/3080): 
    * Get your victim process handle hProcess- by enum processes via like CreateToolhelp32Snapshot or other means
    * (optional) FindResource, LoadResource, LockResource, CreateFile,WriteFile to create the malicious dll on disk. 
    * now the main part will be the code below

```
LPVOID lpBaseAddress = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, other-not-so-impt-args);

WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, lpBaseAddress, lpszDllPath, sum-other-stuff);

HMODULE hModule = GetModuleHandle("kernel32.dll");

LPVOID lpStartAddress = GetProcAddress(hModule, "LoadLibraryA");

CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE), lpStartAddress, lpBaseAddress, 0, NULL); #notice the 1st, 3rd args
```
1.5 Reflective DLL [Injection](https://0x00sec.org/t/reflective-dll-injection/3080):
```
  In the optional step, if there is no CreateFile and WriteFile, 
  but the malware write directly the binary payload from memory (that was loaded from Rsrc) 
  into the victim process via WriteProcessMemory then it's reflective. 
  This is because there's no trace (files) left behind. Highly stealthy. 
```
2. [PE Injection](https://gist.github.com/mantvydasb/229d58d0686cacb7fe52135cf8ee0f1d):
   * Similar to Reflective DLL, this doesn't do CreateFile and Writefile. 
   * Because it's a PE, it needs the IAT (Import Address Table), and Base Relocation Table. However we don't know the absolute address until runtime, so....
   * Use the address return from VirtualAllocEx, iterate through the IAT and RBT and fix them...
   * Before calling CreateRemoteThread

*As you can see, there's very subtle difference and the nuance of each technique is tied directly to their goals* 

3. [Hollowing](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/andreafortuna/d7fb92fb29e4ade27c0c6ce4401c99fa/raw/a8e170d7a394b3e7cec0da094bf5fff5d767b2bf/RunPE.cpp):
   *    CreateProcess in Suspended mode (dwCreationFlag = 0x04)
   *    UnmapView to hollow the victim
   *    VirtualAllocEx + WriteProcessMemory to write malicious binary into the hollowed out region
   *    SetThreadContext (when thread resume, run from the addr of the malicious code) + Resume Thread

4. [Thread Execution Hijack](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/injecting-to-remote-process-via-thread-hijacking):
   * A blend of both Dll inject and Hollowing
   * Find a thread (CreateToolhelp32SnapShot, Thread32First,Thread32 Next)and suspend it (SuspendThread) (similar to dll inject)
   * VirtualAlloc + WriteProcessMemory (shellcode, path to dll or something else) (similar to hollowing - but no Unmap)
   * SetThreadContext + ResumeThread (similar to hollowing)

This technique doesn't create any new thread or process, and thus considered more stealthy. 

5. [Hook Injection](./../L9/L9.md):
   *    First find a process to be hooked
   *    Find the first few bytes of that process, then copied it somewhere
   *    Change that few bytes into a JMP [malicious stuff]. Now the hook is setup. 
   *    In the malicious stuff function. do malicious stuff, then...
   *    [optional] unhook the original function (replace the JMP with the original 6 bytes) for extra stealthiness
   *    JMP back to the original function

Essentially we replace the start bytes of a process with a JMP (hook setup), do our stuff (hooked) then jmp back (with optionally unhooking).

Reference: [here](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/how-to-hook-windows-api-using-c++)

## 8. Potpourri

Malwares and their techniques:
1. Launcher: all 5 injection methods
2. Downloader: UrlDownloadTofile + ShellExecute, WinExec, CreateThread, etc
3. Dropper: FindResource (handle to info block), SizeOfResource, LockResource (find pointer of the resc) LoadResource (handle to data), CreateFile, WriteFile
4. Backdoor: (1) run command from C2 (2) a loading dock for other malware
5. Revershell: tie STARTUPINFO to Winsock and CreateProcess cmd.exe(assignment 2) OR multithread that with 2 pipes and 2 threads
6. RAT: Remcos (assignment 1). Usually a RAT is a multi-purpose malware that is used to control the victim from the C2. It has Backdoor Dropper Launcher Downloader functions. 
7. Botnets: zombies listening to C2 for instruction. May not need Dropper Launcher Downloader. 
8. Trojan: very similar to hooking. 
9. Worm/Virus: They need to spread (usually to other computers in the network or removable drive) and do something. Virus need a host. Worm can make its way through by itself, though it can still choose to inject itself in other program for stealth. 
10. Ransomware: 
    *   Fingerprint (SystemVolumeInformation, versionEx) target
    *   Enum Files 
    *   Encrypt Files (CreateHash, HashData, GetHashParam, CryptDeriveKey,CryptEncrypt)

11. KeyLogger:
    * Type 1: Polling via GetAsyncKeyState() and check state of every key every duration
    * Type 2: Interrupt style via SetWindowsHookEx() 
12. HashDump: GetTheHash via mimikatz to authenticate as admin inside a system. Hash are often LTM or NLTM hashes stored in SAM (lsass.exe, lsaext.dll). This can then be used for Pass-The-Hash attack. 
13. PrivEsc: This is a whole topic by itself. It generally concerns a process getting more privilieges than it should, via unauthorized means. Most malware would want to do this as it allows the malware to have greater capability. There's Local PrivEsc (trying to get to root in that machine) and SeDebugPriv (LocalAdmin in the Domain).


# Closing Remarks

As Prof Tang Xueyan said in CE4013 Distributed System, nothing can replace a full and thorough read through of your materials. What I write is just pointer to focus on more if you do not have enough time. 

All the best for exam  	(((o(*°▽°*)o)))

Finally, I guess it's time to say goodbye. It was a pleasure serving the cohort.
