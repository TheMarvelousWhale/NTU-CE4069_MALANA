Alright let's get started ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ


### <a name="q1">Qn 1</a>

It's a simple Hex to Ascii exercise. Just use [rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html). I use this most of the time for my CTF. 

```
Input: 6e 74 64 6c 6c 2e 64 6c 6c 00
Output: ntdll.dll
```

Side notes:

0 is the null terminator in ascii. It takes the whole byte. 

mov \[ebp+lpbuffer\], eax is just an initialization to the start of the _lpBuffer_ that store the string. 

push offset byte_42CD10 is pushing the arguments (the string you just build by writing bytes into mem area) into the stack. 

### <a name="q2">Qn 2</a>

**In this section and subsequent section, it is important that you keep note of the stack growth as the function proceeds as alot of arguments and local variable are referenced by ebp and offset [ebp + ?? ] -- args, [ ebp - ??] -- local var.**

Disecting the assembly code lines by lines:

```
                push    ebp
                mov     ebp, esp
                push    esi

                <3000 lines later>

                pop     esi
                pop     ebp
                retn
```
Dis is just the prologue and epilogue

```
                cmp     [ebp+arg_0], 1
                jg      short loc_401361
```
compare arg_0 to 1, if arg_0 is greater than 1, jump to loc_401361 

```
                mov     eax, 1
                jmp     short loc_401383
```
Mov 1 to eax then jump to loc_401383 (which is the epilogue). So basically it will exit 1 (exit with error / return 1)

Until now we can visualize the code as this: 

```
def sub_401350(int argc, **char argv){
    if (argc > 1) {  #loc_401361}
    else {      
        return 1
    }
}
```


Moving on to the IF block

```
loc_401361:                            
                mov     eax, [ebp+arg_0]
                sub     eax, 1
                push    eax
                call    sub_401350
                add     esp, 4
                mov     esi, eax
                mov     ecx, [ebp+arg_0]
                sub     ecx, 2
                push    ecx
                call    sub_401350
                add     esp, 4
                add     eax, esi
```
Following the registers:
1. eax = argc
2. eax --;
3. call itself again with argc -1 (Recursion). Assume it returns result into eax.
4. add esp+4 (remove the argument pushed into stack earlier)
5. store the result into esi (for later calculation in add eax, esi)
6. counter = argc 
7. counter -= 2
8. call itself again with argc- 2(Recursion)
9. add esp+4 (remove the argument from the stack). The result is now in eax 
10. add them with earlier result add eax,esi

So in pseudo C:

```
    eax = sub_401350(arg_0 -1)
    esi = eax 
    eax = sub_401350(arg_0-2)
    eax = eax + esi 
```

In its totality:

```
int fib(int a){
    if (a > 1) {
        return fib(a-1)+fib(a-2);
    }
    else {
        return 1
    }
}

```
_In the question sheet, there is a variable declared -- however I do not see a sub, esp 4 in there, hence my code should be technically more correct._

Anyway this fibonacci sequence is indexed from 1 (don't ask me why, ask the prof). So usuallly fib in LeetCode is 

**0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34**

Calling fib(4) by that implementation will return 5 and not the 4th fibonacci (which is 3)

Also it will fail if you call f(0), which yield 1 

### <a name="q3">Qn 3</a>

Rapidtable this
```
Input: 43 45 43 5a 34 30 36 39 46 54 57 00 00 cc cc
Output: CECZ4069FTW'\0''\0''\garbage''\garbage'
```

Let's dive into the code:
```
sub_404000
                push    ebp
                mov     ebp, esp
                sub     esp, 0x04
                mov    dword ptr [ebp-0x04], 0x00
                jmp     loc_404013
```
prologue + declare a local int = 0 (ebp -0x04 is that local var you just declared by sub esp,0x04)

So the whole thing is to just declare a int EGER = 0; 

```
loc_40400F:
                add    DWORD PTR [ebp-0x04],0x01
```
This looks like it is adding 1 to the local in EGER. From here we can guess that this is an increment function. And because it is so weirdly place, 200% this gonna be a do-while loop (since they enter the function block first)

```
loc_404013:
                mov    eax, DWORD PTR [ebp - 0x04]
                mov    edx, DWORD PTR [ebp +0x08]
                add    eax,  edx
                movzx    eax, BYTE PTR [eax]
                test    al, al
                jnz    40400F
```
Following the code:
1. eax = EGER;
2. edx = arr\[arg_to_the_func\] (ebp+0x08 -- trace the stack you will see)
3. add edx to eax (possibly to iterate through an array)
4. movzx (move with zero extended)
5. test al, al -- check if LSByte of EAX is 0
6. if yes jump to the increment

```
loc_404022:
               mov    eax, DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4]
               mov    esp, ebp
               pop    ebp
               ret
```
Move int to eax

In loc_404103: we can see that edx is the start of the array, and everytime we increment eax, we are actually iterating through each byte of the array and check if it's last byte is 0 -- aka check for null terminator. 

So in total, you see that the whole point of loc_404013 is that it check each character, and increment the counter by i if it's not null terminator. This is the exact implementation of the strlen() function. 

In C:

```
    <SOMEWHERE IN THE MEMORY>
    char* siew = "CECZ4069FTW";
    <SNIP>
    def strlen(char* sosig) {
        int i = 0;
        while(sosig[i] != '\0') {i++;}
        return i;
    }
```

That's all for tutorial 4!
